_The tools necessary for the correct deployment of the application are detailed below._

```
Android Studio

### Installation üîß

_Let's first clone the repository in a local environment. To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to deploy the project_

_Type in the terminal the following command to clone the repository_

```
git clone https://github.com/otonielmax/test_reign.git
```

_Once the repository has finished cloning, we open Android Studio and click the File> Open option. We locate the directory where we clone the repository, select it and press OK_

## Deployment üì¶

_To run our application on a mobile device we connect our device through a USB cable to the computer, otherwise we can use the emulators provided by Android Studio. Once we identify that our device is recognized by the IDE, we click on the play button in the upper right. We hope it compiles and we can run our tests._
